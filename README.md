# Indy Client    

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.evernym.com/buildStatus/icon?job=Sovrin%20Client/master)](https://jenkins.evernym.com/job/Sovrin%20Client/job/master/)    

Indy Client provides a command-line tool and underlying interfaces to interact with
a [self-sovereign identity](https://sovrin.org) ecosystem on top of distributed ledger technology.
This codebase will eventually be subsumed by (Indy SDK)[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk);
if you are looking to build a client or agent, we recommend that you use the SDK instead, because
the encapsulation and documentation here are not as clean.

[Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) is more "core" to Indy; if you want to
understand how Indy works, starting there may be better.

All bugs, backlog, and stories for Indy (except the SDK) are managed in [Hyperledger's Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org); use project name INDY.

Developers may want to explore Sovrin's [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin-client/blob/master/getting-started.md) to learn about how Indy works. (Sovrin is the public, open ecosystem
built on top of Indy technology; for more info, see [https://sovrin.org].)

Have a look at [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin-client/blob/master/setup.md)
to understand how to work with the code. Note that setup instructions are still changing hour-by-hour as we identify install preconditions.
